	<p>Here is a quote from Space.com's website:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.space.com/23563-rigil-kentaurus.html">
	Rigel Kentaurus is the third-brightest star in the night sky. 
	However, its brightness is due to the proximity of the system — commonly known as Alpha Centauri — which is the sun's closest neighbor, about 4.3 light-years away from Earth.
